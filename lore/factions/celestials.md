## Celestials

**Note, Most of the factions lore is bound to be enhanced and edited as time goes on. This for now is the foundation to larger things**

The celestial race is an angelic race but serve no God, They were the 2nd race born from the darkness into the world of Tiier.

## Background

The Celestials have been in on and off wars against the 1st race, the Daemons. But currently they are mostly broken down to just petty border skrimishes as they try to advance their technology

## Traits

The celestials have a limited use of the essence of the world mostly to only Celestial Magic rather than elemental or all magic. However the Celestials do have the power of flight, making their rangers a force to be feared.

## Technology

The technological level of the celestials is late medieval ages, which is reflected in their weaponry and armor mostly.
