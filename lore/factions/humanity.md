# Humanity

**Note, Most of the factions lore is bound to be enhanced and edited as time goes on. This for now is the foundation to larger things**

Like everything there is a faction of humanity that was created from the darkness. Though, this humanity isn't like all the others you see in the movies or games. The humans in Tiier are formidable and powerful.

## Background

They are the newest of the 3 races, but they have developed rapidly. When discovered by the Celestial Race/Faction, they were unsure and the celestials forced humanity to treat them as gods.

Once the humans discovered the celestials really weren't godly they rose up and forced them out of their territory.

## Traits

The humans have a special connection to the essence of the world (aka they are very well versed in magic) the magic they posses powers their technology, allowing them to advance rapidly. The essence is basically an unending power source for humanity, which brings them to the same plane as the Daemons and Celestials.

The human spirit is unyielding in the face of danger, the survival instinct takes over and they will do all they can to survive and protect their homes.

## Technology

Humanity is at around a renaissance age, but more with a steampunk view of it. (For an example I would use the Vincl from the game [Rise of Nations: Rise of Legends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rise_of_Nations:_Rise_of_Legends))

There has been little fighting within the human faction, as they've looked towards progress rather than power. (I know it really IS a fantasy game!)
