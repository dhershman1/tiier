# Daemons

**Note, Most of the factions lore is bound to be enhanced and edited as time goes on. This for now is the foundation to larger things**

The Daemon faction is the 1st race born from the darkness, they are a force of chaos but serve their clan chiefs as if they were Gods.

## Background

The first race born into the world of Tiier, the Daemons grew and spread, once the Celestials arrived war errupted however that has dwindled down to little more than border skrimishes at this point.

The Daemons are broken into clans that serve their clan chiefs. The lesser Daemons treat these chiefs as Gods, as they have the most control over the daemonic magics and essence. Making them some of the most powerful Daemons in existence.

## Traits

The Daemon forces have little magic but what magic they do have is incredibly dangerous and those that are able to master it quickly become clan chiefs and worshipped by other Daemons.

The Daemon are a force of chaos, they fight amongst each other unless they are all driven to a single purpose such as a war against one of the other factions.

The daemon are powerful warriors. They make up their lack of essence control with sheer power and force of will. The Celestials flight or even the humans distance with their technology is little concern as the Daemons can quickly close the gap to get in close and personal.

## Technology

The level of technology for the Daemons is around mid-late medieval ages. Their forces are brutish, but effective. Their society and weaponry reflect this the most.
