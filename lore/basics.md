# Lore Basics

This is the basic foundation for the lore of Tiier, the prelude of world events that led up to the games current time

## Time Period

Tiier takes place in what could be considered the middle ages, though in this universe it's a bit different.

## Prelude Story

> Long ago in a plane of existence (now called Tiier) there was no ideology of "right and wrong", the underworld hells and the overworld heavens co existed peacefully aside from the occasional border skrimish.

> Humanity was born from the dark nothingness, on a outer sector of the other two (think of a triangle). Humanity grew, created magic amongst other things but most of all it became a _presence_ amongst the sectors. It was around this time that humanity was noticed by the other two sectors of existence, for fear of balance the heavens attempted to rule, and control the plane of humanity.

> This however, did not go unnoticed by the underworlds hells. Which was what caused the tipping point to start a new, more violent war. The heavens and humanity both waged a war against the hells for several years. Fed up with the iron fist, and strict rule the heavens held in place over humanity, they soon declared war against their would be gods. Thus the war of existance had begun.

> The magics of the 3 sectors was powerful. While each one only pushed more and more, to topple the other. This eventually led to the collapse. Which tore the old world apart, leaving only tiers of existence for each sector. Each plane was a new level of fighting and conquering in an attempt to reach highest peaks of the new world, `Tiier`.
