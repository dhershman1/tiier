Note to self:

Playing with the Map (now board) in build out a proper grid and playable board

we will need to generate a cell with all the specs and stats we expect, for each bit of the grid.

We want to do some probability so that the terrain is varied as it builds out but also contained (water is within water) etc.

Though we may need to use a different formula for building out walls/paths/rooms since these need to be more defined for player movement and the like. These are the pieces I am currently struggling with the most. Once we get past that it's more of the look and feel rather than actually generating things.

Basic information about a map will be predetermined (unless we build a random map generator sandbox later which is cool but different anyway) within a database somewhere.
