# AI

The AI for Tiier is pretty straight forward for now, It's more of an engine as most AI's are for games there is no deep learning behind it.

I was really inspired by the game [Rim World](https://rimworldgame.com/) and the idea of a AI story teller, I wanted to take that up a notch in that this story teller is far more involved with things and you see that interaction through out Tiier.

This is kind of what I am imagining for the AI of Tiier:

- It acts as the storyteller/DM for the match
  - It will build out maps/dungeons based on the users ability, talents, and play style
  - It takes the above into account when plotting how the dungeon layout works and what events/monsters/loot to populate it with
- It will also handle how the NPC's work such as merchants, smiths, etc in the game
- Handle combat using the same type of logic engine
- Picking out how drop tables work and rolling for them
- And a few more... Hidden feature ideas.

Amongst other things this is the base foundation for the **planned** AI of Tiier it will probably do more (_hopefully_)

It's currently able to handle path finding quite well the rest are TODO/WIP obviously
