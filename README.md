# Tiier
A game idea written in [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/)

## Influence/Credits

- [Brogue](https://sites.google.com/site/broguegame/)
  - Brogue plays a huge influence in the stylization and choices behind the design to Tiier

## Features (Wishlist)

- RPG style gameplay. Level up, train, learn different skills
- No Class system
  - In Tiier you don't choose to be an archer, mage, or warrior you start your character at a basic point and build from there. Will you lean towards a certain type? Maybe two? Heck maybe you will choose to be good at everything!
- **Loot**
  - I want to pay a good amount of time to the loot system within Tiier, different levels of loot, and lots of items to collect I always enjoyed games with good loot so I hope I can achieve this with Tiier
- A fun world to explore
  - Overall my goal is to make dungeons/maps use procedural generation to keep them interesting and make them replayable while you hunt for your glorious **Loot**
- And many more!

## Contribution

Want to help? I am building Tiier purely as a side project for fun, and to have fun with [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) and try to become better at using it. Feel free to join in on the fun! That could be literally anything!

- Creating Issues to break down larger tasks or even for tasks I haven't even thought of yet!
  - Ask questions here too! And maybe we will make it a task or feature if your question leads to it!
- Creating PRs with additions to the game
- Creating PRs with fixes to my code that you think could be way better
  - I don't doubt this will be a thing so please explain in your PR why it's better so I can learn!
- Writing lore and story points!
  - You can checkout the already in place [lore here](./lore)
- Spreading the word!
  - Share the repo, and help me expand it
- And there are plenty more ways to help out. Just try!
