# Tiier
A game idea written in [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/)

Well instead of a game this has sort of turned into more of a map generator experiment I was playing with?

## Influence/Credits

  - Brogue plays a huge influence in the stylization and choices behind the design to Tiier

## How To

- Open the `index.html` file

## Contribution

Want to help? I am building Tiier purely as a side project for fun, and to have fun with [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) and try to become better at using it. Feel free to join in on the fun! That could be literally anything!

- Creating Issues to break down larger tasks or even for tasks I haven't even thought of yet!
  - Ask questions here too! And maybe we will make it a task or feature if your question leads to it!
- Creating PRs with additions to the game
- Creating PRs with fixes to my code that you think could be way better
  - I don't doubt this will be a thing so please explain in your PR why it's better so I can learn!
- Writing lore and story points!
  - You can checkout the already in place [lore here](./lore)
- Spreading the word!
  - Share the repo, and help me expand it
- And there are plenty more ways to help out. Just try!
